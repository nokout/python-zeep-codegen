# Research Plan: WSDL to JSON Schema Conversion and Proof of Concept

## Objective
The primary goal of this research is to explore and implement a workflow for converting WSDL (XSD) definitions into JSON Schemas. The focus will be on handling complex XSD structures, including nested elements, collections (e.g., arrays, mappings), and sequences. The generated JSON Schemas will support editing JSON documents, which can then be converted into Python dictionaries for use with the `zeep` library to interact with web services.

## Progress Update
- **Step 1.1: Research how zeep parses WSDL (XSD) definitions**: Completed. Investigated how `zeep` parses WSDL files and generates Python objects. Key findings include its ability to handle WSDL 1.1, partial support for WSDL 2.0, and its dynamic generation of Python classes for XSD types.

- **Step 1.2: Explore tools for handling complex XSD structures**: In progress. Focused on the `xsdata` library, which has shown strong potential for handling complex XSD structures and generating Pydantic models. Initial findings have been documented in `xsdata-research-findings.md`.

## Steps

### 1. Research WSDL to JSON Schema Conversion Tools
1.1 **Research how zeep parses WSDL (XSD) definitions**
   - Investigate how `zeep` can parse WSDL (XSD) definitions and generate Python objects. Focus on understanding its capabilities and limitations. *(Completed)*

1.2 **Explore tools for handling complex XSD structures**
   - Research tools or libraries that can handle complex XSD structures, including nested elements, arrays, mappings, and sequences, and convert them into JSON Schemas. *(In Progress)*

1.3 **Evaluate compatibility of tools with zeep and Pydantic**
   - Assess the compatibility of identified tools with `zeep` and Pydantic models for JSON Schema generation.

### 2. Select Tools and Seek Clarification
- Based on the research, identify the most promising tools or libraries for the task. Seek clarification on specific requirements or trade-offs before finalizing the choice of tools.

### 3. Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC)
3.1 **Develop a workflow for parsing WSDL with zeep**
   - Implement a workflow to parse a complex WSDL (XSD) structure with nested elements, arrays, mappings, and sequences using `zeep`.

3.2 **Convert Python objects to Pydantic models**
   - Develop a method to convert the Python objects generated by `zeep` into Pydantic models.

3.3 **Generate JSON Schemas from Pydantic models**
   - Implement a method to generate JSON Schemas from the Pydantic models created from `zeep` objects.

### 4. Draft a Markdown Document Summarizing Research and PoC
- Summarize the research findings and PoC in a structured Markdown document.
- Include:
  - An explanation of the WSDL to JSON Schema conversion process.
  - A description of the tools or libraries considered, their trade-offs, and the final selection.
  - Code snippets from the PoC demonstrating the workflow for nested elements, arrays, mappings, and sequences.
  - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed.

### 5. Seek Feedback on PoC and Research Document
- Share the PoC and the Markdown document for review.
- Gather feedback on the approach, implementation, and recommendations.

### 6. Refine the PoC and Research Document
- Incorporate feedback to finalize the PoC and the Markdown document.
